    "You are to design a baby as an fsm. Your baby has three states : Sleeping (also initial), Hungry and Crying.  Your baby's interface to the world is via three signals: green, yellow, red. She sets green high when sleeping, yellow high when hungry and red high when crying. She stays in the state crying unless she is fed and returns to sleeping state when fed. \n",

    " You are to design a mother as finite state machine. Mother has three inputs green,yellow,red. Mother is initially in birth state then she makes a transition to Content state. She stays in that state as long as the input to the module is green. if not her state changes to observant State. In the observant state if she receives a green input she returns back to the Content state and if not she passes to feeding state. Mother states in the feeding state as long as she recives a green. She has only one output: milk. She sets milk high in the feeding state.\n",
